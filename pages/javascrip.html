Its red and blue scale is at zero; a dream scaled. Since Fire Opal is, a level six and having more than one causes trouble for the other player; {a summon skull for a pendulums monster only if I was lucky to get a high scale for the others cards in mine hand} Anyway, thanks to magic I see mine worst hand with this 3x fire opal and 3x Foucault cannon {going second}…. Since that possible and it happen in the <a href="https://duelingnexus.com/editor/bfb38f8a225eb6ffd0e7c200798d768f">Nexus</a> often {even in magic the gathering getting 4x of two cards and I have more manna then the cards they gave me I happens in almost every game with the same cards also...  the possibly right?} In an older version on this build I had used (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlacarynCloudWorld/TheOlacarynCloud/061ba0e/99666430.jpg">Jinzo – Layered</a> and <a href="Dhampir%20Vampire%20Sheridan">Dhampir Vampire Sheridan</a>) {which I might added in a side maybe? But I might ended up with running the main jinzo or spell canceller} but using in the extra deck Dhampir was the clear choice since the used the same “take control effect” Jinzo would had been better if it stop traps also since the two six monster {in mine head} sounds harder to get on the field then just two monster for a link summon… So to concould this monster is a level 6 with scaled zero and the attack is 2500 and the defense is 1000. {And I took this out the deck for some other reasons and added the acv monster dragon I will added that later.}<!--more--></p><p><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco, monospace;"><strong>Flavor text: </strong></span></p><p><strong>“</strong>This dinosaur pack leader with a burning head of stone is named after his finishing move.” / {Owned me head &gt;.&gt;} anyways this monster must be on the side on the dinosaur part of the Risebells book {what I’m calling those kids last names; rise at the bell of when life was simpler and better. [Well I think that all the normal monster in the book are place in the same area maybe even fight together for their Draconia (the effect monster are place somewhere else as in the space or a different dimension or hell or haven or even on the same maps)]} So the leader of all these monster somehow I wanted to know how that is the leader of the normal pendulums…maybe I don’t know… {Hulks comics}</p><p>This is not the leader of the normal monster it clear must be <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlacarynCloudWorld/TheOlacarynCloud/061ba0e/14105623.jpg">Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon</a>(how is that a dragon that more like a dyno is one of the alien monster?) these normal monster must treated odd-eyes like a god compare to other monsters in Draconia. {Yes I added this back to the normal pendulums I should add more to the story but I awful story teller.

Even played dhampir vampire Sheridan in this just for that dream with two or more of both these cards 2x in mine hand {thanks magic} (also there risebell and level 5). This one has a pendulum effect for piercing damage with a normal monster &gt;.&gt; yes a normal monster and not a just “non-effect monster”. However, the pricing effect is just useless since the strongest attack is 3000 with links and special summons defense monster like <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlacarynCloudWorld/TheOlacarynCloud/061ba0e/2563463.jpg">Wandering Gryphon Rider</a>, and lancephorhynchus and fire opal head is the strongest of the normal pendulums you will not use that pendulum effect often enough to have lancepgorhynchus too be usefully(story of mine life) in the scale and ether destroy it with effect of with antihuman intelligence ME-PSY-YA of bring it out with synchro monster Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon… to Xyz with hopefully another level six on the field for Dhampir.<!--more--></p><p><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco, monospace;"><strong>Flavor Text:</strong></span></p><p>“This primordial species survived extinction by evolving an offensive lance that can pierce anything, although its diet still consists mainly of fish.” From the book of Risebell at least in this part of the story the dinosaur must had lived through the meteor attack {aka <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlacarynCloudWorld/TheOlacarynCloud/a3ac3b9/95676943.jpg">Extinction on Schedule</a> (did they just tried to kill all the humans?)}.

And I should just give it up and take it out it for something more used for like Breaker the magical warrior, king tiger wanghu, fossil dyna, or even performapal but I am old and suborned. There also the normal pendulums without effect that should be taken out for these cards… oh well what a wasted of space foucault’s cannon… a good mystic mine destroy though.<br /><!--more--></p><hr /><p><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco, monospace;"><strong>Flavor Text:</strong></span></p><p>“A mechanized life form, roving through space-time.

Dynamite; I had change deck or didn’t get 3/40 chance not to mention getting more than one in mine hand. ) even if I get two hand I get to the monster effect that cannot be destroyed by battle and take no damage; if I got to hit with three normal monster somehow and made damaged Go! Effects gets to equal the mine opponent’s life points {xD He LP the first word in of a book in 4<sup>th</sup> grade}.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Archfiend Eccentrick</strong></p><p><strong>                 </strong>The golden queen of the archfiends {well the unwanted child from the ruler and the reason of the eccentricks is how much she steals… they even dress her like someone will take her.} with the best ability in the games. In the pendulums zone she get to destroy a spell and traps, but with herself; now if you’re lucky you would have another high scale in your hand {the best part about going second} put that on the field on the field used the magic of pendumlums summons to summons her on the field again well in the extra zone then get to destroy a monster also… {Maybe one day I waited this right}</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Effect monster </strong></p><p><strong>Deskbot 001</strong></p><p><strong>                </strong>One card short and it sounds better then feather duster… match is the searchable of Crstron jlkahgdhaghhdgahlgh it the worst card to get in your hand though the destbot since dargoog is the only the other machine the deck… and playing the nexus you get this deskbot 001 in your staring hand a lot… it even came back onto the field after you token summons. {The hit the numbers the nerves of these people there nothing as a fair game [just like in life they bully people until death (when have they been nice it liked when they were nice is over nothing last)}</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Extra Deck </strong></p><p><strong>Synchro</strong></p><p><strong>Baronne de Fleur</strong></p><p><strong>            </strong>The Best lady in the game (aka the pink power ranger). With the effects to destroy one card per user turn, and the options to specials summon a level 9 or lower {thanks I can’t get itself out for the counter}. Sure it counter effects is nice even destroy the card with nice with those effects that you can used more than once per turn. Sadly you could just use it once with summon (any summon IDK).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</strong></p><p>The level 8 that excavate the top of the deck for light or dark monster witch is great that about all mine effect pendulums monster and then match which with PSY (which you can read in PSY no need for the extra words and repeated I could).</p><p><strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong></p><p>The Crystron Halqifibrax, Mecha token best option just to get the two counter…honstely I don’t know if that that better than just getting chaos for the search of over killed but it’s great for the first turn.</p><p><strong>Red Wyvern (because Goyo Predator is an card to replace guardian) </strong></p><p><strong>            </strong>Well after the tokens with crystron and mecha synchro attacks (names) you are left with one token and hallohallo that 6 stars synchro I was thinking to used Metaphys Horus for the synchro but no it’s only good for the second turn I was “flirting” with the idea of using the card with this version of normal but scaps it for reason…. &gt;.&gt; how I mean testing the ideas of using this card.</p><p><strong>Cupid Pitch</strong></p><p>A great way card with the token and the destbot get to do damage with cupid and then get an increase of level by one to synchro summons a level 8 between chaos ruler and borreload. As stated in anouther entry of card chaos ruler dose excavate 5 cards from the top of your deck, but borreload dose counter with no card destruction (god they even make it harder to remember words) &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt; done ask… there card rotator for dark world… at least no read them</p><p> </p><p><strong>XYZ</strong></p><p><strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong></p><p><strong>            </strong>The ultimate card break. Yo you didn’t caused devastation to all the different card on the field with these normal scale? Still have the xyz with a single material? Sky thunder is the best bet to grab. Have Sky Thunder wait until your opponents hit the battle phase with whatever pathetic (useless card) that they play you get to “send” all card all the field to the graveyard. xD I just loved that part.</p><p><strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong></p><p>The one I have not played enough to know how to used it well… it sounds like a dream card but liked another card that I shall not name now (time theft well it wasn’t time theft but I forgot the name of it… it might as well be this card.) it often back fired from what I understand from using the card… the one that activated on the field xD I still don’t understand how they destroy skill drain with monster effects go figure something I never understand.</p><p><strong>Evilswarm Exciton Knight</strong></p><p><strong>            </strong>Playing Goblins show me this cards. It almost put sky thunder to shame. That can used on both player turn and destroy all the cards on the fields. If it lived through your opponent main phase it’s great but that often happen anymore.</p><p><strong>Muzurhythm the String Djinn</strong></p><p><strong>            </strong>The one that often get to control sky thunder since it double attack with 3000 attack that would kill some of the monster not all…</p><p> </p><p><strong> </strong><strong>Dhampir Vampire Sheridan</strong></p><p><strong>            </strong>Two level 6 six so that the first normal pendulums on in this deck… this is great when it’s destroys a monster it can detach one to gain control of the monster of that monster and with the first effect detaching one material to destroy one over power monster to take control of it… Now day they were non-destroy or unaffected by other cards… so that ruins the ideas</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Link</strong></p><p><strong>Unchained Abomination (Saryuja Skull Dread) (aka underworld goddess)</strong></p><p><strong>            </strong> Change it to saryuja why for the second turn hand to get the extra cards… and if I go second I wanted the otk back but there just too many traps…</p><p><strong>Black Luster Soldier - </strong><strong>Soldier of Chaos</strong></p><p><strong>            </strong>If you couldn’t get any other card you might be able to get this out of the field.</p><p><strong>Mecha Phantom </strong><strong>Beast Auroradon and Crystron Halqifibrax</strong></p><p>The combo they might ban … there goes mine chance of winning.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The side</strong></p><p>Are just cards that I try using for a great build of this deck?</p><p> </p><p>I’m done for now. I might edit the text later and add lore to the normal cards with their flavor text… I still wanted to see that side of the show again or also I think it was part of the first series and not series 0…0 the one in the manga or real life…</p><p> </p><p>what wrong playing these &gt;.&gt; like in real life yugioh the user who goes first normally wins so with playing these pendulums the traps cars like Anti-Spell Fragrance. the users can’t even use the pendulums scales… with macro cosmos all cards goes in the banished zone instead of the extra deck then the synchro Naturia Beast that will stop all your scale playing pendulums is awful choice of deck to played with since these cards. Also there secret village of the spell casters with only on spell caster that can be normal summon {magicalibra} place the monster on the scales is almost impossible with a 3/40 chance an 0.075 to get one of them in the first hand not to mention when they have that field card out. Also there ash that stop the combo two nothing... it seem to happen every time I get a good hand, but yeah this deck is trashed and will not win anything it’s the worsted deck to played…espilly if you played pendulums</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Failures</p><p><strong>Number 97: Draglubion and Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong></p><p><strong>            </strong>Number 97… number 100 with number 38. To be fair I don’t really think I need this if I am going fisrt and I could just use number 38 so that two cards I can “flirt” with since tinder &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt; … soooo I put it in there for the Overkilled but I havnt taken it out yet for something else I do get two card to “flirt” with.  I guess one could be a rank 6 xyz and other another rank 4 xyz… idk even elder entity N’tss sounds better too played with then number 97 and number 100</p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlacarynCloudWorld/TheOlacarynCloud/061ba0e/43785278.jpg">Foucault's Cannon</a></p><p>Foucault’s cannon: A low red blue scaled of two at a level 5 spellcaster monster. Cannon pendulums effects is on the better side, but it’s slow…. Well its pendulums effects only works in the end phase and it only target one face up spell or traps… The best option to go for the field spell card. {Me; I am little depressed about cannon effect since it at the end phases and compare to eccentrick with is also an effect monster that can be normal summon without trouble (I mean tribute summon); the scale is the only reason to cannon.} this card is a joke and I havnt found a good used for it for that effect and playing pendulums is the biggest joke in the joke or I mean let down to played. And I should just give it up and take it out it for something more used for like Breaker the magical warrior, king tiger wanghu, fossil dyna, or even performapal but I am old and suborned. There also the normal pendulums without effect that should be taken out for these cards… oh well what a wasted of space foucault’s cannon… a good mystic mine destroy though.</p><p><strong>Flavor Text</strong></p><p>“A mechanized life form, roving through space-time. But the mysterious thing is that its memory i... m...stly gone. W...at is t...e reason? D..... refuse t... b.... interfered w...h?” {thanks funny joke yeah reused but gotta force how did you know}</p><p>This is must had been made from one <strong>the machine maker</strong> must be a spellcaster. Why is the card a spellcaster; maybe of dark magician family (renamed risebell) made the machine and change it from a machine into a spell caster from the power of their magic. The new cannon that hold their magical energy into this dimension machine. The dimensions of space and times to help blast/destroy the item just in the niche of time. {im trying to think what there trying to destroy also I wanted to think how to added the sky striker into stop it since I was going to them be anilens come the sky with advance techongy [since I it got turn into a video game at some point and it could be the story of the game] I don’t know… I’m just thinking of how to world it}</p><p> </p><p>“Non-effect”</p><p>While I was playing on the <a href="https://duelingnexus.com/editor/9bbe8ea940724e49d0241fa268ee1d2c">nexus</a> (link to deck) with differ normal pendulum the ones to test/flirt {as in played them way to many time to figure out how they work} I found out that <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlacarynCloudWorld/TheOlacarynCloud/a3ac3b9/31897444.jpg">defender of labyrinth</a> works on some the normal effect pendulums like <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlacarynCloudWorld/TheOlacarynCloud/a3ac3b9/7868571.jpg">mealfoes</a> {even with the a pendulum effect} it had still gave that pendulums monster that boost of attack; while though with “<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlacarynCloudWorld/TheOlacarynCloud/a3ac3b9/18756904.jpg">white elephant’s gift</a>” if I remember.. This magic card wont active since the it counts like “effect monster” &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt; WHY is as bad of the rainbow neos… But it does stated in white elephant’s gift that need to go the graveyard.</p><p> </p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlacarynCloudWorld/TheOlacarynCloud/a3ac3b9/86346643.jpg">Rainbow neos</a> and pendulums</p><p>&gt;.&gt; it’s just doesn’t work &lt;.&lt; I mean the when a pendulums monster on the field as magic card it spell and trap effect doesn’t active, and even the monster effect dose not work… there sky thunder that send everything to the graveyard why dose that work? Also the banishing effect of psyichic end punisher shouldn’t work with this idea…</p><p>I hate once per turn… it mine opponent turn why can’t I used the effect. That is still a turn…</p><p> </p><p>Mistakes bloopers if you wanted to read them….</p><p>[Great I wanted a new subtext but I don’t how to extruded right (you know how they say the holy spirited is in everyone doesn’t that mean Satan is god?

To fill the sentence &gt;.&gt; thanks police…. {Get it xD since the quoted and rent and housing hey I get 3 square meal when they make me go back}.
